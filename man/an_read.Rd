\title{Load Antarctic place name data}
\usage{
an_read(
  gazetteers = "all",
  sp = FALSE,
  cache,
  refresh_cache = FALSE,
  simplified = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gazetteers}{character: vector of gazetteers to load. For the list of available gazetteers, see \code{\link{an_gazetteers}}. Use \code{gazetteers = "all"} to load all available gazetteers. Currently only one gazetteer is available: the Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica}

\item{sp}{logical: if FALSE return a data.frame; if TRUE return a SpatialPointsDataFrame}

\item{cache}{string: the gazetteer data can be cached locally, so that it can be used offline later. Valid values are \code{"session"}, \code{"persistent"}, or a directory name. Specifying \code{cache = "session"} will use a temporary directory that persists only for the current session. \code{cache = "persistent"} will use \code{rappdirs::user_cache_dir()} to determine the appropriate directory to use. Otherwise, if a string is provided it will be assumed to be the path to the directory to use. In this case, an attempt will be made to create the cache directory if it does not exist. A warning will be given if a cached copy of the data exists and is more than 30 days old}

\item{refresh_cache}{logical: if TRUE, and a data file already exists in the cache, it will be refreshed. If FALSE, the cached copy will be used}

\item{simplified}{logical: if TRUE, only return a simplified set of columns (see details in "Value", below)}

\item{verbose}{logical: show progress messages?}
}
\value{
a data.frame or SpatialPointsDataFrame, with the following columns (note that not all information is populated for all place names):
\itemize{
  \item gaz_id - the unique identifier of each gazetteer entry. Note that the same feature (e.g. "Browns Glacier") might have multiple gazetteer entries, each with their own \code{gaz_id}, because the feature has been named multiple times by different naming authorities. The \code{scar_common_id} for these entries will be identical, because \code{scar_common_id} identifies the feature itself
  \item scar_common_id - the unique identifier (in the Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica) of the feature. A single feature may have multiple names, given by different naming authorities
  \item place_name - the name of the feature
  \item place_name_transliterated - the name of the feature transliterated to simple ASCII characters (e.g. with diacritical marks removed)
  \item longitude and latitude - the longitude and latitude of the feature (negative values indicate degrees west or south). Note that many features are not point features (e.g. mountains, lakes), in which case the \code{longitude} and \code{latitude} values are indicative only, generally of the centroid of the feature
  \item altitude - the altitude of the feature, in metres relative to sea level. Negative values indicate features below sea level
  \item feature_type_name - the feature type (e.g. "Archipelago", "Channel", "Mountain")
  \item date_named - the date on which the feature was named
  \item narrative - a text description of the feature; may include a synopsis of the history of its name
  \item named_for - the person after whom the feature was named, or other reason for its naming. For historical reasons the distinction between "narrative" and "named for" is not always obvious
  \item origin - the naming authority that provided the name. This is a country name, or organisation name for names that did not come from a national source
  \item relic - if \code{TRUE}, this name is associated with a feature that no longer exists (e.g. an ice shelf feature that has disappeared)
  \item gazetteer - the gazetteer from which this information came (currently only "CGA")
}
If \code{simplified} is FALSE, these additional columns will also be included:
\itemize{
  \item meeting_date - the date on which the name was formally approved by the associated naming authority. This is not available for many names: see the \code{date_named} column
  \item meeting_paper - references to papers or documents associated with the naming of the feature
  \item remote_sensor_info - text describing the remote sensing information (e.g. satellite platform name and image details) used to define the feature, if applicable
  \item coordinate_accuracy - an indicator of the accuracy of the coordinates, in metres
  \item altitude_accuracy - an indicator of the accuracy of the altitude value, in metres
  \item cga_source_gazetteer - for the Composite Gazetteer, this entry gives the source gazetteer from which this entry was taken. This is currently either a three-letter country code (e.g. "ESP", "USA") or "GEBCO" (for the GEBCO gazetteer of undersea features)
  \item country_name - the full name of the country where \code{cga_source_gazetteer} is a country
  \item source_name - the cartographic/GIS/remote sensing source from which the coordinates were derived
  \item source_publisher - where coordinates were derived from a map, the publisher of that map
  \item source_scale - the scale of the map from which the coordinates were derived
  \item source_institution - the institution from which the coordinate information came
  \item source_person - the contact person at the source institution, if applicable
  \item source_country_code - the country from which the coordinate information came
  \item source_identifier - where a coordinate or elevation was derived from a map, the identifier of that map
  \item comments - comments about the name or naming process
}
}
\description{
Place name data will be downloaded and optionally cached locally. If you wish to be able to use \code{antanym} offline, consider using \code{cache = "persistent"} so that the cached data will persist from one R session to the next. See \code{\link{an_cache_directory}} to get the path to the cache directory.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
 ## download without caching
 g <- an_read()

 ## download to session cache, in sp format
 g <- an_read(cache = "session", sp = TRUE)

 ## download and cache to a persistent directory for later, offline use
 g <- an_read(cache = "persistent")

 ## refresh the cached copy
 g <- an_read(cache = "persistent", refresh_cache = TRUE)

 ## download and cache to a persistent directory of our choice
 g <- an_read(cache = "c:/my/cache/directory")
}
