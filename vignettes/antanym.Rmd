## Overview

This R package provides easy access to Antarctic geographic place name information, and tools for working with those names.

The authoritative source of place names in Antarctica is the Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica (CGA), which is produced by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR). The CGA consists of approximately 37,000 names corresponding to 19,000 distinct features. It covers features south of 60 &deg;S, including terrestrial and undersea or under-ice features.

There is no single naming authority responsible for place names in Antarctica because it does not fall under the sovereignty of any one nation. In general, individual countries have administrative bodies that are responsible for their national policy on, and authorisation and use of, Antarctic names. The CGA is a compilation of place names that have been submitted by representatives of national names committees from 22 countries.

The composite nature of the CGA means that there may be multiple names associated with a given feature. Consider using the `an_preferred()` function for resolving a single name per feature.

For more information, see the [CGA home page](http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/). The CGA was begun in 1992. Since 2008, Italy and Australia have jointly managed the CGA, the former taking care of the editing, the latter maintaining the database and website. The SCAR [Standing Committee on Antarctic Geographic Information (SCAGI)](http://www.scar.org/data-products/scagi) coordinates the project. This R package is a product of the SCAR [Expert Group on Antarctic Biodiversity Informatics](http://www.scar.org/ssg/life-sciences/eg-abi) and SCAGI.

## Installing


```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SCAR/antanym")
```

## Usage

Start by fetching the names data from the host server. Here we use a temporary cache so that we can re-load it later in the session without needing to re-download it:

```{r}
library(antanym)
g <- an_read(cache = "session")
```

If you want to be able to work offline, you can cache the data to a directory that will persist between R sessions. The location of this directory is determined by `rappdirs::user_cache_dir()` (see `an_cache_directory("persistent")` if you want to know what it is):

```{r eval = FALSE}
g <- an_read(cache = "persistent")
```

If you prefer working with `sp` objects, then this will return a `SpatialPointsDataFrame`:
```{r as_sp, eval = FALSE}
gsp <- an_read(sp = TRUE, cache = "session")
```

### Data summary

How many names do we have in total?
```{r}
nrow(g)
```

Corresponding to how many distinct features?
```{r}
length(unique(g$scar_common_id))
```

We can get a list of the feature types in the data:
```{r}
head(an_feature_types(g), 10)
```

### Data structure

A description of the data structure can be found in the `an_load` function help, (the same information is available via `an_cga_metadata`). By default, the gazetteer data consists of these columns:
```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(an_cga_metadata())
```

A few additional (but probably less useful) columns can be included by calling `an_read(..., simplified = FALSE)`. Consult the `an_read` documentation for more information.

### Finding names

The `an_filter` function provides a range of options to find the names you are interested in.


#### Basic searching

A simple search for any place name containing the word 'William':
```{r}
an_filter(g, query = "William")
```

We can filter according to the country or organisation that issued the name. Which bodies (countries or organisations) provided the names in our data?
```{r}
an_origins(g)
```

Find names containing "William" and originating from Australia or the USA:
```{r}
an_filter(g, query = "William", origin = "Australia|United States of America")
```

Compound names can be slightly trickier. This search will return no matches, because the actual place name is 'William Scoresby Archipelago':
```{r}
an_filter(g, query = "William Archipelago")
```

To get around this, we can split the search terms so that each is matched separately (only names matching both "William" and "Archipelago" will be returned):
```{r}
an_filter(g, query = c("William", "Archipelago"))
```

Or a simple text query but additionally constrained by feature type:
```{r}
an_filter(g, query = "William", feature_type = "Archipelago")
```

Or we can use a regular expression:
```{r}
an_filter(g, query = "William .* Archipelago")
```

### Regular expressions

Regular expressions also allow more complex searches. For example, names matching "West" or "East":
```{r}
an_filter(g, query = "West|East")
```

Names **starting** with "West" or "East":
```{r}
an_filter(g, query = "^(West|East)")
```

Names with "West" or "East" appearing as complete words in the name ("\\b" matches a word boundary; see `help("regex")`):
```{r}
an_filter(g, query = "\\b(West|East)\\b")
```

#### Spatial searching

We can filter by spatial extent:
```{r}
an_filter(g, extent = c(100, 120, -70, -65))
```

The extent can also be passed as Spatial or Raster object, in which case its extent will be used:
```{r}
my_sp <- sp::SpatialPoints(cbind(c(100, 120), c(-70, -65)))
an_filter(g, extent = my_sp)
```

Searching by proximity to a given point, for example islands within 20km of 100 &deg;E, 66 &deg;S:
```{r}
an_near(an_filter(g, feature_type = "Island"), loc = c(100, -66), max_distance = 20)
```

### Resolving multiple names

As noted above, the CGA is a composite gazetteer and so there may be multiple names associated with a given feature. 

Find all names associated with feature 1589 (Booth Island) and show the country of origin of each name:
```{r}
an_filter(g, feature_ids = 1589)[, c("place_name", "origin")]
```

The `an_preferred` function can help with finding one name per feature. It takes an `origin` parameter that specifies one or more preferred naming authorities (countries or organisations). For features that have multiple names (e.g. have been named by multiple countries) a single name will be chosen, preferring names from the specified \code{origin} naming authorities where possible.

We start with `r nrow(g)` names in the full CGA, corresponding to `r length(unique(g$scar_common_id))` distinct features. Choose one name per feature, preferring the Polish name where there is one, and the German name as a second preference:
```{r}
g <- an_preferred(g, origin = c("Poland", "Germany"))
```

Now we have `r nrow(g)` names in our data frame, corresponding to the same `r length(unique(g$scar_common_id))` distinct features.

Features that have not been named by either of our preferred countries will have a name chosen from another country, with those countries in random order of preference.


### Using the pipe operator

All of the above functionality can be achieved in a piped workflow, if that's your preference, e.g.:

```{r}
nms <- g %>% an_filter(feature_type = "Island") %>% an_near(loc = c(100, -66), max_distance = 20)
nms[, c("place_name", "longitude", "latitude")]
```

### Working with sp

If you prefer to work with Spatial objects, the gazetteer data can be converted to a SpatialPointsDataFrame when loaded:

```{r}
gsp <- an_read(cache = "session", sp = TRUE)
```

And the above functions work in the same way, for example:
```{r}
my_sp <- sp::SpatialPoints(cbind(c(100, 120), c(-70, -65)))
an_filter(gsp, extent = my_sp)
```

### Selecting names for plotting

Let's say we are preparing a figure of the greater Prydz Bay region (60-90 &deg;E, 65-70 &deg;S), to be shown at 80mm x 80mm in size (this is approximately a 1:10M scale map). Let's plot all of the place names in this region:

```{r map0}
my_longitude <- c(60, 90)
my_latitude <- c(-70, -65)

this_names <- an_filter(g, extent = c(my_longitude, my_latitude))

if (!requireNamespace("rworldmap", quietly = TRUE)) {
  message("Skipping map figure - install the rworldmap package to see it.")
} else {
  library(rworldmap)
  map <- getMap(resolution = "low")
  plot(map, xlim = my_longitude + c(-7, 4), ylim = my_latitude, col = "grey50")
  ## allow extra xlim space for labels
  points(this_names$longitude, this_names$latitude, pch = 21, bg = "green", cex = 2)
  ## alternate the positions of labels to reduce overlap
  pos <- rep(c(1, 2, 3, 4), ceiling(nrow(this_names)/4))
  pos[order(this_names$longitude)] <- pos[1:nrow(this_names)]
  text(this_names$longitude, this_names$latitude, labels = this_names$place_name, pos = pos)
}
```

Oooooo-kay. That's not ideal.

Antanym includes an experimental function that will suggest which features might be best to add names to on a given map. These suggestions are based on maps prepared by expert cartographers, and the features that were explicitly named on those maps. We can ask for suggested names to show on our example map:

```{r}
suggested <- an_suggest(g, map_extent = c(my_longitude, my_latitude), map_dimensions = c(80, 80))
```

Plot the top ten suggested names purely by score:

```{r map1}
this_names <- head(suggested, 10)

if (!requireNamespace("rworldmap", quietly = TRUE)) {
  message("Skipping map figure - install the rworldmap package to see it.")
} else {
  plot(map, xlim = my_longitude + c(-7, 4), ylim = my_latitude, col = "grey50")
  points(this_names$longitude, this_names$latitude, pch = 21, bg = "green", cex = 2)
  pos <- rep(c(1, 2, 3, 4), ceiling(nrow(this_names)/4))
  pos[order(this_names$longitude)] <- pos[1:nrow(this_names)]
  text(this_names$longitude, this_names$latitude, labels = this_names$place_name, pos = pos)
}
```

Or the ten best suggested names considering both score and spatial coverage:

```{r map2}
this_names <- an_thin(suggested, n = 10)

if (!requireNamespace("rworldmap", quietly = TRUE)) {
  message("Skipping map figure - install the rworldmap package to see it.")
} else {
  plot(map, xlim = my_longitude + c(-7, 4), ylim = my_latitude, col = "grey50")
  points(this_names$longitude, this_names$latitude, pch = 21, bg = "green", cex = 2)
  pos <- rep(c(1, 2, 3, 4), ceiling(nrow(this_names)/4))
  pos[order(this_names$longitude)] <- pos[1:nrow(this_names)]
  text(this_names$longitude, this_names$latitude, labels = this_names$place_name, pos = pos)
}
```

## Future directions

Antanym currently only provides information from the SCAR CGA. This does not cover other features that may be of interest to Antarctic researchers, such as those on subantarctic islands or features that have informal names not registered in the CGA. Antanym may be expanded to cover extra gazetteers containing such information, at a later date.

## Other packages

The [geonames package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=geonames) also provides access to geographic place names, including from the SCAR Composite Gazetteer. If you need *global* place name coverage, geonames may be a better option. However, the composite nature of the CGA is not particularly well suited to geonames, and at the time of writing the geonames database did not include the most current version of the CGA. The geonames package requires a login for some functionality, and because it makes calls to api.geonames.org it isn't easily used while offline.
